## Steps To Creating This Clone, Then Expanding

### Step 1: Auth

Build and return a GET request for a Spotify user's authentication

```javascript
// Login.jsx

const AUTH_URL = `${GET}?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&response_type=${RESPONSE_TYPE}&redirect_uri=${REDIRECT_URI}&scope=${SCOPE}`;
```

## Architecture

- `public`
- `src`
  - `assets`
  - `App.jsx`: Pass through our Login component
  - `Login.jsx`: Where we build and send a GET request to request a Spotify user's authorization
  - `main.jsx`
- `index.html`
- `vite.config.js`

## Style Guide

### CSS

Using Bootstrap (imported in `App.jsx`) and Rect Bootstrap.
